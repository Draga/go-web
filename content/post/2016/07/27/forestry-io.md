A reader of {{< relref "post/2016/05/21/hugo-host-and-deployment.md" >}} pointed out in the comments that it's now possible to write online Hugo posts from {{ exLink Forestry.io "https://forestry.io" }}. I've been playing with it and I'm currently using it to write this very post.

As far as writing online goes it's a big improvement over scribe.io. I'm just not sure that's enough to make me switch to online.
