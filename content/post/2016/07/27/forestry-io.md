A reader of {{< relref "post/2016/05/21/hugo-host-and-deployment.md" >}} pointed out that it's now possible to write online Hugo posts from {{ exLink Forrestry.io "https://forestry.io" }}. I've been playing with it and I'm currently using it to write this very post.
As far as writing online goes it's big inmprovement over scribe.io
