A reader of {{< relref "post/2016/05/21/hugo-host-and-deployment.md" >}} pointed out in the comments that it's now possible to write online Hugo posts from {{ exLink Forestry.io "https://forestry.io" }}. I've been playing with it and I'm currently using it to write this very post.

As far as writing online goes it's a big improvement over scribe.io. I'm just not sure that's enough to make me switch to online writing.

I love the preview. Ufortunately it's not good enough as it doesn't work with all Hugo's shortcodes and custom ones too.
What I would suggest instead is to have a test website. Forestry.io uses the development branch, just hook a new website under a test domain! Just make sure is not going to be indexed.

Forestry.io is not responsive or mobile friendly either, so keep that in mind if you wish to blog from your mobile.


love preview, not 100% working, suggest setting up a test website to preview properly under different domain (carefull of duplicated content)
no mobile yet
can't move posts to another folder
spell check doesn't work
tries to accommodate Jekyll and Hugo at the same time
